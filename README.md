### ðŸª£ [An Ecclectic Mess](/Final_Challenges/Challenges.html) ðŸ§¹

This was not a page assignment in of itself, but rather a series of 10 challenges that I chose to place onto one page.

Assignments contained on this page:

1. Center an image on the page with rounded edges and a filter effect

2. Add a footer to the page with centered text that is bold

3. Create a table and style it

4. Place text over top of an image

5. Create a fixed navigation bar and include a hover effect

6. Create two columns side-by-side and style them

7. Create a hover effect for a `<p>` element on the page.

8. Create an image overlay fade.

9. Embed a video and have it autoplay on mute on a loop.

10. Place a text overlay on top of a video.
